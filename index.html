		Hello! My name is Nate Adams, I am a fourth year Mathematical Science - Computer Science student at the University of Montana. I have interest in high powered computing, mathematic computation, and linux system administration. I am currently working at the University as a Student Infrastructure Admin, assisting our Network, Telecom, Audio/Video, and HPC teams. I also manage my own Homelab, using Raspberry Pi's to manage two servers, one to deploy apps with docker and another connected to a storage device with Open Media Vault. I am also looking to do more math computation, finishing my brute force attempt at the Traveling Salesman Problem, and then looking at other Graph Theory and Number Theory computations.
