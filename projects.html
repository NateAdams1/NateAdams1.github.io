		<h4>
			Traveling Salesman Problem (Fall Semester 2025)
		</h4>
		<p>
			This project was a problem done for CSCI 491 Special Topics - HPC. In this project, I made a brute force algorithm to compute TSP for a random set of points on a plane. This was made in serial, in parallel, and will be updated to be a more efficient MPI program and have a CUDA script. This was used to learn more in depth MPI and CUDA package specialties. There is a github repo that was made with a README with instructions for its use.
